                Here it is. The most dreaded and easy to forget css code. How to center a div. 
                Just why can't they do it with one line of code like they have with many other
                functions that are arguably less needed than this one! 
                <br>
                Well even though this isn't a one code fix, here is one way to center a div that
                should always work.
            </p>
              <pre><code>
    <!-- Horizontally and vertically align -->
    .code {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        height: 100vh;
        margin: 0;
    }
    </code></pre>
    <p class="paragraph">If there is one thing to keep in mind whilst using this, 
        then it'd be to make sure to put <code class="single-line-code">display: flex;</code> in your 
        body!
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">Maybe you'd benefit from bookmarking this! You probably need the function
        alot!
